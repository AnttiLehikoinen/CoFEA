# What is CoFEA?

CoFEA is an initiative that aims to bring open-source simulation software closer to industry standards. Even though CoFEA itself sounds like the magic drink which drives engineering minds, it is a combination of the words *cooperation* and *Finite Element Analysis*. That truly describes the goals of this project which are:

* raise awareness of available open-source simulation software
* increase confidence in using this software by testing it with benchmarks and real-life problems
* develop Python tools and scripts to make usage easier and simpler
* gather information on how to set up the simulation environment correctly

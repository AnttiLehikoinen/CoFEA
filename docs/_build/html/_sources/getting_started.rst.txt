First steps with CoFEA
======================

The CoFEA module is written in a way that allows to either create a mesh from scratch or import it from different source. Here is the example how to prepare a mesh which is then exported to Calculix input deck. It can also be exported to .db file from which it can be imported back.

>>> # example: prepare db file from scratch
>>> # prepare nodes
>>> n1 = cofea.Node(nLabel=1, nCoords=(1.0, 0.0, 0.0))
>>> n2 = cofea.Node(nLabel=2, nCoords=(0.0, 1.0, 0.0))
>>> n3 = cofea.Node(nLabel=3, nCoords=(0.0, 0.0, 1.0))
>>> # put nodes into the list
>>> nodeList = [n1, n2, n3]
>>> # prepare elements
>>> e1 = cofea.Element(elType='C3D4', elLabel=1,
>>>                elConnect=(0, 1, 2),
>>>                partAllNodes=nodeList)
>>> # put elements into the list
>>> elementList = [e1, ]
>>> # create part from nodes and elements
>>> part = cofea.PartMesh(partName='TestPart',
>>>                   partNodes=nodeList,
>>>                   partElements=elementList)
>>> # put parts into the list
>>> partList = [part, ]
>>> # create a model
>>> model = cofea.ExportMesh(modelName='test',
>>>                      listOfParts=partList)
>>> # do some operations with the model
>>> # for example export model to calculix file
>>> model.exportToCalculix(exportedFilename='test.inp')
>>> # or save it to db file
>>> model.saveToDbFile('dbFile.db')

In order to load the mesh from db file, the following function can be used:

>>> # example: load mesh from db file
>>> m = cofea.ExportMesh.importFromDbFile(pathToDbFile='dbFile.db')
>>> m.exportToCalculix(exportedFilename='test.inp')

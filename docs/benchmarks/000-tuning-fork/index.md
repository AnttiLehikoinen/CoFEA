# Tuning fork benchmark

## Model definition

The aim of this study is to compare the results from a modal analysis performed in [CalculiX](http://www.calculix.de/), [Code_Aster](https://code-aster.org/) and [Elmer](http://www.elmerfem.org/blog/) Finite-Element codes. A tuning fork geometry will be used to measure the software performance. The model described in this report was created on a basis of the article found in this [link](http://pubs.sciepub.com/ajme/4/7/16/index.html).
